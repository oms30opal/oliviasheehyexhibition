  <h1>My Purpose</h1>
  <p class= "dotted">“Femme Life Exhibition” aims to present everything big and small about a girl’s<br> life and everything and anything about girl culture. This exhibition shines a <br>light on the light-hearted, carefree moments, whether it be whispering a secret into<br>the ear of your best friend, picking flowers for a bouquet, trying out a new <br>makeup look, or even window shopping on a Friday afternoon in the mall. In my goal <br>to represent girls and women, I included works of both real and fictional girls <br>and women. I included these fictional females because I believe they play a part <br>in representing and empowering the female viewer. </p>
  <p class= "dotted">I believe in representing women of a wide range of shapes, sizes, and colors in <br>order to display the diversity that encapsulates the world. Every girl and woman <br>deserves to have a piece of media where they can admire a positive depiction of <br>someone who looks like them. </p>
  <p class= "dotted">While I acknowledge that there is no shortage of women who look like me <br>represented in the media (white skin with brown hair), as a kid, I consumed a lot of <br>media geared towards my male counterparts.  This meant that these media pieces <br>mainly featured a cast of male characters, with maybe one or two female side <br>characters, more often than not there to serve as a mom or a love interest. While I <br>did enjoy the episodes, I felt myself wanting to see more girls featured in a <br>positive manner. Even though children’s media has shifted its gears a lot compared <br>to a decade ago, my purpose still lives on. I want all girls and women to feel <br>represented through this exhibition, and give them a chance to see some like them <br>being featured in the spotlight.</p>
